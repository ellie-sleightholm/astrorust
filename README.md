# AstroRust

![Version 0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-blue)

An astrodynamics Rust library. Please note, I am in the process of building this to be used as a public crate. 

# Build Instructions
These instructions assume that Rust and Cargo are installed on your system. 

To set up this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ellie-sleightholm/astrorust.git
    cd astrorust
    ```
2. To use the AstroRust crate:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
This will build everything you need to use astrorust. 

3. Running,
    ```bash
    cargo run --example time
    ```

will execute the time example.
